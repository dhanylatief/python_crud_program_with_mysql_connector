# Python CRUD Application for Healthcare Industry

A comprehensive Python application for managing patient queue data with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

## Business Understanding

This project caters to the healthcare industry, specifically addressing the need to manage patient queue data efficiently. Patient queue plays a crucial role in making sure a hospital's day-to-day operations remain smooth. It also helps in recognizing problems that might arise in the hospital's service, such as certain departments or subspecialties being understaffed, prioritizing patients who paid more in the same queue, etc.

**Benefits:**

* Improved data accuracy and consistency
* Streamlined data management processes
* Enhanced decision-making through readily available data
